## About
This webpage is designed to help guide where/what the user will eat for ALL THREE meals of the day.

User will choose Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner.

Then choose the type of cuisine they wish to eat for that specified meal time.(E.G Korean or Omelettes).

They will then choose the location in which they will be around for that meal time.(E.G Seattle, or more specific, Capitol Hill Seattle, WA ).

Then they will choose the price point they want to stay within for that specific meal.

After all parameters are selected the page will display five options for them to choose from and they can decide on which one they want for that meal time selection.

The choice that was selected will then store in the database and display within the associated spot on the webpage.

They then move on to the next meal time and re-run through the steps to make those choices.

After all three meals have been chosen they can choose whether or not to have the choices emailed or texted to them for referall.
